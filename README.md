Pebble is a calm, minimal daily organizer designed to turn big intentions into small, clear actions. It replaces noise with focus, allowing you to break down overwhelm into manageable steps — one pebble at a time. Built with a simple state-driven architecture and local persistence, Pebble prioritizes clarity, stability, and quiet usability over feature sprawl. It does not gamify productivity or impose urgency; instead, it offers a steady space where thoughts can settle and momentum can build gently. Pebble doesn’t promise transformation — it simply helps you reach what you hope to reach, without pressure.
